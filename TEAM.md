Thatâ€™s a great starting point â€” clustering teams by playing style is a powerful way to uncover tactical patterns. Here are **some other compelling data visualization and analysis ideas** you can explore with soccer team datasets, depending on what type of data you have (event data, tracking data, match stats, etc.):

---

### âš½ **Tactical & Performance Analysis**

1. **Formation & Pass Network Maps**

   * Visualize average player positions and passing connections.
   * Useful for comparing formations and ball circulation patterns.

2. **Attacking & Defensive Zones**

   * Heatmaps of where a team creates chances or applies pressure.
   * Can be split by game phase (e.g., build-up vs. final third).

3. **Possession Value Models (e.g., xThreat)**

   * Visualize how teams move the ball into dangerous areas.
   * Compare possession effectiveness across teams.

### ðŸ“Š **Statistical Team Profiles**

4. **Radar Charts / Team Style Profiles**

   * Show metrics like xG, possession, passes per defensive action (PPDA), direct speed, aerial duels, etc.
   * Useful for comparing tactical identities (e.g., high-pressing vs. deep-block teams).

5. **Rolling Averages / Trendlines**

   * Plot metrics over time (xG difference per match, pressing intensity).
   * Spot tactical shifts or performance slumps.

6. **Expected Goals (xG) For vs. Against**

   * Scatter plot to analyze balance between attacking and defensive quality.
   * Highlight overperforming/underperforming teams.

### ðŸ§  **Unsupervised Learning & Segmentation**

7. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)**

   * Reduce multiple team features (passes, duels, shots) into 2D space to visualize similarity.
   * Helps identify clusters of teams (e.g., pressing teams vs. low-block counter teams).

8. **Team Archetype Clustering**

   * Use K-Means or Hierarchical clustering on team metrics (e.g., xG, possession, progressive passes).
   * Label cluster types like "Possession Dominant", "Counter-Attacking", "Direct Long Ball".

---

### ðŸ§® **Efficiency & Style Metrics**

9. **Pass Style Index**

   * Average pass length, pass completion %, number of switches/through balls.
   * Use ternary plots to visualize balance between short, medium, and long passes.

10. **xG Efficiency**

* Ratio of goals to xG (finishing efficiency), or conceded goals vs. xGA (goalkeeping/defense quality).
* Helps find overperformers or underperformers.

11. **PPDA vs. Direct Speed**

* Good for visualizing pressing intensity vs. attacking directness.
* Often used in data scouting and team profiling.

---

### ðŸ§© **Game Context & Strategy**

12. **Game State Analysis**

* Break metrics down by game state (winning, drawing, losing).
* Do teams dominate only when ahead? Do they press more when behind?

13. **First Half vs. Second Half Performance**

* Identify fatigue effects or tactical adjustments.

14. **Set Piece Effectiveness**

* Analyze how many xG/goals are generated from corners, free-kicks, and throw-ins.

---

### ðŸ“ˆ **Ranking & Comparison**

15. **Bar Charts & Rankings**

* Show top teams in terms of key metrics (e.g., xG per 90, high turnovers, SCA per match).
* Add contextual color coding (e.g., top 5 leagues, relegation zone).

16. **Spider Plots for Matchups**

* Compare two teams before a match â€” style, strength, weaknesses.

If you let me know what type of team data you have (e.g., match-level stats, event-level passes/shots, tracking), I can suggest tailored visualizations or help write code for one of these ideas.
