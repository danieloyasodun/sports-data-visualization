Finding Underrated Talent: Unique Stat Combinations

To uncover underrated players, you should look for metrics that highlight effectiveness but aren’t always reflected in traditional stats like goals or assists. Here are some great X vs. Y combinations that can reveal undervalued talent across different positions:
1. Progressive Passes per 90 vs. Key Passes per 90

(X = Progressive Passes per 90, Y = Key Passes per 90)
Who it helps find: Underrated deep-lying playmakers
Insight:

    Progressive Passes measure how often a player moves the ball forward significantly, showing involvement in buildup play.

    Key Passes track passes that directly lead to a shot, indicating a player’s direct contribution to shot creation.

    Players with high values in both categories may be elite creators who are not recognized due to playing deeper in midfield.

Example: Thiago Alcântara, Frenkie de Jong, Enzo Fernández
2. Successful Pressures per 90 vs. Progressive Carries per 90

(X = Successful Pressures per 90, Y = Progressive Carries per 90)
Who it helps find: Pressing wingers and aggressive midfielders
Insight:

    High successful pressures show defensive work rate and pressing ability.

    High progressive carries highlight players who break defensive lines with movement.

    This combination reveals hard-working, technical dribblers who disrupt opposition attacks and carry the ball forward.

Example: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Eberechi Eze, Alexis Mac Allister
3. Interceptions per 90 vs. Progressive Passes per 90

(X = Interceptions per 90, Y = Progressive Passes per 90)
Who it helps find: Defensive midfielders who contribute in attack
Insight:

    High interceptions show defensive awareness and ball-winning ability.

    High progressive passes indicate a player's ability to contribute offensively after winning possession.

    This reveals underrated defensive midfielders who are not just ball-winners but also distributors.

Example: Declan Rice, João Palhinha, Mikel Merino
4. Shots on Target per 90 vs. Non-Penalty Expected Goals per 90 (npxG/90)

(X = Shots on Target per 90, Y = npxG per 90)
Who it helps find: Strikers who consistently generate high-quality shots
Insight:

    Shots on target per 90 shows how often a player gets quality shots.

    npxG per 90 indicates how frequently a player gets into goal-scoring positions, without penalties inflating the data.

    This helps find forwards who consistently create and finish high-quality chances but might be underrated due to low finishing numbers or playing in weaker teams.

Example: Evan Ferguson, Santiago Giménez, Ollie Watkins
5. Progressive Carries per 90 vs. Expected Assists per 90 (xA/90)

(X = Progressive Carries per 90, Y = xA per 90)
Who it helps find: Underrated creative dribblers
Insight:

    High progressive carries show players who move the ball forward efficiently.

    High expected assists (xA) highlight players who create high-quality chances.

    Players who rank highly in both are creative wingers or midfielders who combine dribbling with chance creation.

Example: Jérémy Doku, Florian Wirtz, Pedro Neto
6. Defensive Actions per 90 vs. Pass Completion %

(X = Defensive Actions per 90, Y = Pass Completion %) Who it helps find: Ball-playing defenders who also defend aggressively
Insight:

    High defensive actions per 90 (tackles + interceptions) show defensive involvement.

    High pass completion % highlights defenders who are comfortable on the ball.

    This helps identify underrated center-backs who are strong both defensively and in possession.

Example: Jurrien Timber, William Saliba, Gonçalo Inácio
7. Expected Goals per Shot vs. Shots per 90

(X = xG per Shot, Y = Shots per 90) Who it helps find: Forwards with elite shot selection
Insight:

    xG per shot measures how good a player’s shot selection is (higher values = better-quality chances).

    Shots per 90 shows how often a player gets into goal-scoring positions.

    Players with high values in both are elite finishers who consistently find high-quality chances.

Example: Victor Boniface, Ivan Toney, Jonathan David
8. Progressive Passes Received per 90 vs. Touches in the Box per 90

(X = Progressive Passes Received per 90, Y = Touches in the Box per 90) Who it helps find: Attackers who consistently receive dangerous passes
Insight:

    Progressive passes received shows how often a player is a target for forward passes.

    Touches in the box show how frequently they are involved in attacking areas.

    This helps identify attackers who get into good positions even if their finishing numbers aren’t high yet.

Example: Cody Gakpo, João Pedro, Rasmus Højlund

Finding underrated players involves identifying hidden value beyond conventional stats like goals and assists. Here are some alternative visualizations that can help uncover hidden gems:
1. Percentile Ranks (Radar/Spider Charts)

📊 What it shows: A player's strengths across multiple metrics in one view.
📍 Why it’s useful: Helps compare a player's skill set relative to peers, highlighting well-rounded or elite performers in niche areas.
🔧 Example metrics:

    Progressive carries

    Key passes per 90

    Pressures per 90

    Expected assists (xA)

    Defensive actions

🛠 Tool: ggplot2 (R), ggiraphExtra, ggRadar
2. Bar Chart with Percentiles

📊 What it shows: How an individual player ranks across different categories.
📍 Why it’s useful: Helps identify undervalued specialists, like high-volume progressive passers or elite dribblers with low goal contributions.
🔧 Example: Rank midfielders by progressive passes + defensive actions to find underrated deep-lying playmakers.

🛠 Tool: ggplot2, ggthemes
3. Possession Value Model (Heatmaps)

📊 What it shows: Where on the pitch a player is most influential.
📍 Why it’s useful: Finds players who contribute outside of traditional attacking metrics, such as deep-lying playmakers, press-resistant midfielders, or progressive dribblers.
🔧 Example: A heatmap showing where progressive passes and carries occur on the pitch.

🛠 Tool: ggplot2, sf (for spatial data)
4. Non-Traditional Scatter Plots

📊 What it shows: Correlations between less conventional stat pairs.
📍 Why it’s useful: Helps find players who excel in unique ways.
🔧 Examples:

    Progressive Passes per 90 vs. Pass Completion % → Finds midfielders who break lines while keeping possession.

    Defensive Actions per 90 vs. Pressures per 90 → Finds underrated ball-winning midfielders.

    Expected Goals per Shot vs. Shot Volume → Finds efficient goal scorers rather than just high-volume shooters.

🛠 Tool: ggplot2, ggrepel (for labels)
5. Network Graphs (Pass Maps)

📊 What it shows: How players connect and influence their team’s play.
📍 Why it’s useful: Finds underrated playmakers who might not register many assists but are key in buildup play.
🔧 Example: A pass map showing which players exchange the most progressive passes.

🛠 Tool: igraph, ggraph, ggplot2
6. Box Plots for Outlier Detection

📊 What it shows: Distribution of stats across the league, highlighting underrated outliers.
📍 Why it’s useful: Finds players performing well in categories that are rare.
🔧 Example:

    A box plot of dribbles completed per 90 to find high-volume dribblers who don’t necessarily play for top clubs.

🛠 Tool: ggplot2, geom_boxplot()
7. Expected Goals (xG) vs. Actual Goals Charts

📊 What it shows: Players who outperform or underperform their expected output.
📍 Why it’s useful: Finds underrated strikers who generate good chances but haven’t converted them yet (good for future breakout candidates).

🛠 Tool: ggplot2, ggrepel

Each of these approaches highlights different types of underrated players, whether it's press-resistant midfielders, progressive passers, efficient shooters, or defensive workhorses. Let me know if you want help implementing one in R! 🚀
