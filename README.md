## Sports Analytics: Uncovering Insights Through Data

### Description
This repository is a collection of projects and experiments where I practice and learn data visualization using R and Python. I explore NBA stats and play-by-play data from [here](https://github.com/shufinskiy/nba_data) to create visualizations, inclusing shot charts, heatmaps and other anlytical graphics. The goal is to develope a deeper understanding of data story telling and sports analytics.

### Leaderboard Plot

**Programming Languag**: R

### Diamond Plot
[`diamond_plot`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/sports-data-visualization/blob/main/diamond_plot/diamond_plot.R)

The chart is a visual representation of NFL teams' offensice and defensive performance using Expected Points Added (EPA) per play for the 2024-2025 regular season. It loads in play-by-play data, filters relevant plays, and calculates average offensive and defensive EPA for each team. The data is then plotted on a rotated scatterplot, with teams positioned based on their offensive and defensive efficienct, and categorized into four performance quadrants ("Good O, Bad D"). The team logos are for added clarity and the plot is styled with color coded regions and customized labels.

**Programming Language**: R

### Hotspot Chart
[`hotspot`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/nba-data-visualization/blob/main/hotspotchart/hotspot.R)

The charts show the areas of the court where the player prefers (and dislikes) to shoot from. It visualizes their shooting tendencies relative to league average. The darker and denser the red area the more frequently the players from that location. The gray areas represent spots where the player shoots less often than their peers, areas with no color indicate locations where player's shot selection aligns with the league average.

**Programming Language**: R

### Computer Vision Football Analysis
[`football_analysis`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/football_analysis)

This project aims to detect and track players, referees, and footballs in video using YOLO, a top AI object detection model, and improve its performance through training. Using K-means clustering to assign players to teams based on shirt colors, calculate ball possession percentage and track player movement with optical flow. Perspective transformation will convert movement from pixels to meters. Finally, weâ€™ll calculate player speed and distance covered, addressing real-world challenges suitable for both beginners and experienced machine learning engineers.

**Programming Language**: Python

**Libraries/Frameworks**: YOLO, OpenCV, K-means, Optical Flow, Perspective Transformation
