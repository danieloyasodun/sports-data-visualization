## Sports Analytics: Uncovering Insights Through Data

### Description
This repository is a collection of projects and experiments where I practice and learn data visualization using R and Python. I explore NBA stats and play-by-play data from [here](https://github.com/shufinskiy/nba_data) to create visualizations, inclusing shot charts, heatmaps and other anlytical graphics. The goal is to develope a deeper understanding of data story telling and sports analytics.

This project uses **unsupervised machine learning** to identify and group **attacking players** based on their performance metrics during the **2024â€“25 season** in Europeâ€™s Big 5 Leagues. Rather than relying on subjective labels like "striker" or "winger," this approach groups players by how they *actually* play â€” using data-driven player profiles.

#### Objective:
To identify and label distinct attacking profiles (e.g., Support Forward, Ball-Dominant Star, Elite Creator) using underlying contributions â€” not just headline stats like goals or assists.

#### Workflow Summary:  
  1. Feature Engineering
    Cleaned and selected key per-90 stats to describe attacking tendencies, including:
     - `xG`, `xA`, `Shots`, `Key Passes`, `Progressive Passes`, `Dribbles`, `Carries into Final â…“`, `Penalty Area Touches`, `Pass Completion %`, `SCA`, `GCA`, and more.
     - Scaled all features using `StandardScaler` for uniformity.
  2. Dimensionality Reduction
    Applied **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** o capture variance in 2â€“3 dimensions, enabling better visualization and noise reduction
  3.Clustering Algorithm
    - Used **K-Means** clustering to group similar players into distinct style-based categories.
  - Determined optimal cluster count using:
    - Elbow Method (for within-cluster variance)
    - Silhouette Score (for cluster separation)
  4. Labeling and Interpretation
    - Analyzed z-score averages of each cluster to assign descriptive tactical profiles like *Elite Creator* or *Pressing Forward*
  5. Visualization
    - *PCA Scatter Plot*: Each dot = 1 player, positioned by style and color-coded by cluster
    - *Cluster Heatmap*: Shows average z-scores across features per cluster to highlight strengths and traits

#### Cluster Legend:
| Cluster | Label                |
|---------|----------------------|
|   0     | Support Forward      |
|   1     | All-Around Attacker  |
|   2     | Elite Creator        |
|   3     | Link Play Forward    |
|   4     | Secondary Creator    |
|   5     | Dribbling Playmaker  |
|   6     | Pressing Forward     |
|   7     | Ball-Dominant Star   |

### Progressive Passes per 90 vs Key Passes per 90 (24-25 Season Big 5 Leagues)
[`prog_vs_kp`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/sports-data-visualization/blob/main/worldfootballr/prog_vs_kp/prog.R)

[`plot`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/sports-data-visualization/blob/main/worldfootballr/prog_vs_kp/big5_prgp_vs_kp_top15.png)

This scatter plot visualizes **Progressive Passes per 90 vs. Key Passes per 90** to spotlight the most creative and influential passers across all positions in the 2024â€“25 season from Europeâ€™s Big 5 Leagues.
  - **Progressive Passes (PrgP)** quantify how often a player moves the ball significantly forward toward the opponentâ€™s goal, reflecting their role in buildup play, tempo control, and ball advancement through opposition lines.
  - **Key Passes (KP)** represent passes that directly lead to a shot, capturing the players who consistently create scoring opportunities for their teammates.

This visualization captures two key dimensions of creativity:
  - **High PrgP**: Often associated with **deep-lying playmakers**, press-resistant midfielders, or fullbacks who initiate attacks and help teams gain territory.
  - **High KP**: Typically seen in **advanced creators** â€” attacking midfielders, wingers, or forwards who provide the final ball before a shot.

Key Findings:
  - **Top 15 in Progressive Passes per 90**: *Bruno Fernandes, Joshua Kimmich, Pedri, Angelo Stiller, Rodrigo De Paul, Frenkie de Jong, Martin Ã˜degaard, Manuel Locatelli, Vitinha, Florian Tardieu, Dani Ceballos, FabiÃ¡n Ruiz PeÃ±a, IÃ±igo MartÃ­nez, Granit Xhaka*
    - These players are pivotal in orchestrating play from deeper zones, progressing the ball with intent and precision.
  - **Top 15 in Key Passes per 90**: *Isco, Bukayo Saka, Raphinha, Arda GÃ¼ler, Kevin StÃ¶ger, Junya Ito, Alex Baena, Lee Kang-in, Franck Honorat, Michael Olise, Kevin De Bruyne, Rayan Cherki, Ousmane DembÃ©lÃ©, DÃ©sirÃ© DouÃ©*
    - Elite playmakers in the final third â€” these players thrive in tight spaces, creating high-quality chances through incisive passing.
  - **Top 15 in Both Categories**: *Luka ModriÄ‡*
    - This select group excels at both advancing possession and generating shots, blending ball progression with end-product creativity â€” making them some of Europeâ€™s most complete creators.

By comparing these two metrics, the plot reveals not just who racks up assists, but who drives creativity from all over the pitch â€” whether it's the pass before the assist, or the buildup that leads to goals.

### Leaderboard Plot
[`leaderboard_plot`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/sports-data-visualization/blob/main/leaderboard_plot/leaderboard.R)

[`plot`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/sports-data-visualization/blob/main/leaderboard_plot/defensive_stops_per100.png)

This chart displays a **facet-wrapped leaderboard** ranking the **top 50 NBA players** by **Defensive Stops Per 100 Possessions** (as of **March 20, 2025**). The data comes from [pbpstats.com](https://pbpstats.com), and Iâ€™ve filtered for players with at least **1,500 defensive possessions** to ensure a meaningful sample size. A **Defensive Stop** is calculated as: Steals + Recovered Blocks + Offensive Fouls Drawn + Charge Fouls Drawn And **Stops Per 100** is determined by: (Defensive Stops / Defensive Possessions) * 100. This stat provides a **broader measure of defensive impact** beyond traditional stats like **steals and blocks**, focusing on how effective a player is at **ending an opponentâ€™s possession**. Many great defendersâ€”like **Lu Dort and Draymond Green**â€”donâ€™t accumulate high steals or blocks but still rank **inside the top 20** due to their ability to disrupt plays in other ways. **Guards** may not block many shots, but they excel in **steals, drawing charges, and recovering loose balls**. **Big men** might not generate steals but contribute with **blocks and contested rebounds**. The chart uses:**Custom borders** colored based on each team's **primary and alternate colors** and **Team logos** for added clarity  

**Programming Language**: R

**Packages Used**: `tidyverse`, `jsonlite`, `hoopR`, `ggimage`, `janitor`
