## Sports Analytics: Uncovering Insights Through Data

### Description
This repository is a collection of projects and experiments where I practice and learn data visualization using R and Python. I explore NBA stats and play-by-play data from [here](https://github.com/shufinskiy/nba_data) to create visualizations, inclusing shot charts, heatmaps and other anlytical graphics. The goal is to develope a deeper understanding of data story telling and sports analytics.

This visualization presents soccer player skill profiles as radar (pizza) charts, allowing for easy comparison of player attributes across multiple performance metrics. Inspired by modern football analytics, these charts synthesize attacking, passing, and defensive stats into a single compact graphic.

Each radar chart shows normalized values (z-scores) for a selection of key performance indicators (per 90 minutes), including:
  - Key Passes
  - xA (Expected Assists)
  - Final â…“ Passes
  - Penalty Area Passes (PPA)
  - Progressive Passes (PrgP)
  - Pass Completion %
  - Dribbles
  - Tackles Won
  - Progressive Carries
  - Shot-Creating Actions (SCA)
  - Goal-Creating Actions (GCA)
  - Ball Recoveries

These stats are drawn from Europeâ€™s Big 5 Leagues during the 2024â€“25 season, and each player's values are standardized relative to others in their position group (e.g., midfielders vs forwards). This provides contextualized comparisons and surfaces player strengths clearly.

ðŸ“Š Use Cases:
  - Scouting comparisons
  - Tactical fit assessment
  - Fan-facing visual storytelling
  - Player development profiling

**Programming Language**: Python

**Packages Used**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `mplsoccer`, `numpy`

### Progressive Passes per 90 vs Key Passes per 90 (24-25 Season Big 5 Leagues)
[`prog_vs_kp`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/sports-data-visualization/blob/main/worldfootballr/prog_vs_kp/prog.R)

[`plot`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/sports-data-visualization/blob/main/worldfootballr/prog_vs_kp/big5_prgp_vs_kp_top15.png)

This scatter plot visualizes **Progressive Passes per 90 vs. Key Passes per 90** to spotlight the most creative and influential passers across all positions in the 2024â€“25 season from Europeâ€™s Big 5 Leagues.
  - **Progressive Passes (PrgP)** quantify how often a player moves the ball significantly forward toward the opponentâ€™s goal, reflecting their role in buildup play, tempo control, and ball advancement through opposition lines.
  - **Key Passes (KP)** represent passes that directly lead to a shot, capturing the players who consistently create scoring opportunities for their teammates.

This visualization captures two key dimensions of creativity:
  - **High PrgP**: Often associated with **deep-lying playmakers**, press-resistant midfielders, or fullbacks who initiate attacks and help teams gain territory.
  - **High KP**: Typically seen in **advanced creators** â€” attacking midfielders, wingers, or forwards who provide the final ball before a shot.

Key Findings:
  - **Top 15 in Progressive Passes per 90**: *Bruno Fernandes, Joshua Kimmich, Pedri, Angelo Stiller, Rodrigo De Paul, Frenkie de Jong, Martin Ã˜degaard, Manuel Locatelli, Vitinha, Florian Tardieu, Dani Ceballos, FabiÃ¡n Ruiz PeÃ±a, IÃ±igo MartÃ­nez, Granit Xhaka*
    - These players are pivotal in orchestrating play from deeper zones, progressing the ball with intent and precision.
  - **Top 15 in Key Passes per 90**: *Isco, Bukayo Saka, Raphinha, Arda GÃ¼ler, Kevin StÃ¶ger, Junya Ito, Alex Baena, Lee Kang-in, Franck Honorat, Michael Olise, Kevin De Bruyne, Rayan Cherki, Ousmane DembÃ©lÃ©, DÃ©sirÃ© DouÃ©*
    - Elite playmakers in the final third â€” these players thrive in tight spaces, creating high-quality chances through incisive passing.
  - **Top 15 in Both Categories**: *Luka ModriÄ‡*
    - This select group excels at both advancing possession and generating shots, blending ball progression with end-product creativity â€” making them some of Europeâ€™s most complete creators.

By comparing these two metrics, the plot reveals not just who racks up assists, but who drives creativity from all over the pitch â€” whether it's the pass before the assist, or the buildup that leads to goals.

**Programming Language**: R

**Packages Used**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `ggrepel`

### Leaderboard Plot
[`leaderboard_plot`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/sports-data-visualization/blob/main/leaderboard_plot/leaderboard.R)

[`plot`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/sports-data-visualization/blob/main/leaderboard_plot/defensive_stops_per100.png)

This chart displays a **facet-wrapped leaderboard** ranking the **top 50 NBA players** by **Defensive Stops Per 100 Possessions** (as of **March 20, 2025**). The data comes from [pbpstats.com](https://pbpstats.com), and Iâ€™ve filtered for players with at least **1,500 defensive possessions** to ensure a meaningful sample size. A **Defensive Stop** is calculated as: Steals + Recovered Blocks + Offensive Fouls Drawn + Charge Fouls Drawn And **Stops Per 100** is determined by: (Defensive Stops / Defensive Possessions) * 100. This stat provides a **broader measure of defensive impact** beyond traditional stats like **steals and blocks**, focusing on how effective a player is at **ending an opponentâ€™s possession**. Many great defendersâ€”like **Lu Dort and Draymond Green**â€”donâ€™t accumulate high steals or blocks but still rank **inside the top 20** due to their ability to disrupt plays in other ways. **Guards** may not block many shots, but they excel in **steals, drawing charges, and recovering loose balls**. **Big men** might not generate steals but contribute with **blocks and contested rebounds**. The chart uses:**Custom borders** colored based on each team's **primary and alternate colors** and **Team logos** for added clarity  

**Programming Language**: R

**Packages Used**: `tidyverse`, `jsonlite`, `hoopR`, `ggimage`, `janitor`
